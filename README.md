The most famous competition over the kaggle (Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster)

```Let's Begin```

## Competition Description

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, I have to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, I have to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## This Notebook will show basic examples of:

- Data Handling
- Importing Data with Pandas
- Cleaning Data

## Data Analysis
Supervised Machine learning Techniques: DecisionTree Classification which give me to get 79.5% accuracy score and to rank under 4100 in this Kaggle competition. 


**Competition Website**: [kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)

## Result
The output of the code is to predict the survival(0-Die,1-Survive) of the passenger who borded on the Titanic.
